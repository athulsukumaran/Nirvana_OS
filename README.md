# Nirvana_OS
Custom linux OS developed on Linux kernel 4.15.3.

Nirvana OS is developed by building all components of a basic linux operating system manually. This is, naturally, a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. The advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.

The distinguished Nirvana Operating System is built by using an already installed Ubuntu distribution. This existing Linux system (the host) is used as a starting point to provide necessary programs,including a compiler, linker, and shell, to build the new system.
